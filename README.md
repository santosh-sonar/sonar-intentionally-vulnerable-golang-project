# Sonar Intentionally vulnerable Golang project


Forked from https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/intentionally-vulnerable-golang-project with configuration to scan with Sonarqube community / Enterprise / Cloud

This is just a minimal repo for testing Soanrqube against an intentionally vulnerable list of 
dependencies, and as well showing a small example of how to use it with github actions
